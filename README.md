- The implementation and project structure is heavily inspired by [Sonner](https://github.com/emilkowalski/sonner).  
- [This Video](https://youtu.be/8JTrY1dlXCw?si=B_pPfoHoedujRUxa) on Sonner by [@joschan21](https://github.com/joschan21) was my inspiration to create a similar library for modal handling.
